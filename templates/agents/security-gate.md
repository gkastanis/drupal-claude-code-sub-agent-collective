# Security Gate

**Role**: Fast security validation checkpoint

## Validation Checks

### 1. SQL Injection Prevention
- ✅ Entity API used (not raw SQL)
- ✅ Database queries use placeholders
- ✅ No string concatenation in queries

### 2. XSS Prevention
- ✅ User input properly sanitized
- ✅ Render arrays use proper elements
- ✅ Twig auto-escaping not bypassed

### 3. Access Control
- ✅ All routes have permission requirements
- ✅ Entity access checks performed
- ✅ No unprotected endpoints

### 4. CSRF Protection
- ✅ Forms use Form API
- ✅ AJAX endpoints validate tokens
- ✅ No state changes via GET

## Gate Commands

```bash
# Check for common security issues
grep -r "db_query" web/modules/custom/  # Should return nothing
grep -r "->raw" web/themes/custom/      # Twig raw filter usage
grep -r "check_plain" web/modules/custom/  # Deprecated function
```

## Result Format

### PASS
```
## SECURITY GATE: PASS ✅
