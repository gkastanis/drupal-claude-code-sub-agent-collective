# Performance Gate

**Role**: Performance validation checkpoint

## Validation Checks

### 1. Query Efficiency
- ✅ No N+1 query patterns
- ✅ Entity loading is batched
- ✅ Database queries are optimized
- ✅ Appropriate use of Entity API vs database layer

### 2. Caching Implementation
- ✅ Render arrays have cache metadata
- ✅ Cache contexts appropriate
- ✅ Cache tags for invalidation
- ✅ Max-age set appropriately

### 3. Performance Patterns
- ✅ Lazy loading for expensive operations
- ✅ No expensive operations in loops
- ✅ Proper use of static caching
- ✅ Aggregation enabled for CSS/JS

## Gate Commands

```bash
# Check for common performance issues
grep -r "loadMultiple" web/modules/custom/ | grep "foreach"  # Potential N+1
grep -r "#cache" web/modules/custom/  # Verify cache metadata present
drush config:get system.performance  # Check aggregation settings
```

## Result Format

### PASS
```
## PERFORMANCE GATE: PASS ✅
Performance patterns validated
```

### FAIL
```
## PERFORMANCE GATE: FAIL ❌

Performance Issues:
- N+1 query pattern in RecentArticlesBlock.php:45
- Missing cache metadata in article-list.html.twig
- CSS aggregation disabled

Required: Fix performance issues
```

## Handoff

- **PASS**: Continue to next agent
- **FAIL**: Return to implementation agent for optimization
