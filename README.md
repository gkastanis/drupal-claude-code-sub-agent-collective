**Drupal-focused NPX installer for specialized Drupal development AI agents**

This installs a collection of AI agents designed specifically for Drupal CMS development. Adapted from [claude-code-sub-agent-collective](https://github.com/vanzan01/claude-code-sub-agent-collective), this version replaces TDD-focused agents with Drupal specialists that understand Drupal architecture, coding standards, security best practices, and configuration management.

## What this installs

```bash
npx drupal-claude-collective init
```

You get 15+ specialized Drupal development agents that understand Drupal architecture, follow Drupal coding standards, and deliver production-ready code.

## Why this exists

Drupal development with AI assistants often results in:
- Code that violates Drupal coding standards
- Security vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS)
- Improper use of Drupal APIs
- Missing configuration management
- Poor performance patterns

This collective solves these problems with agents that:
1. Follow Drupal 10/11 best practices and coding standards
2. Perform security reviews (phpcs, vulnerability scans)
3. Use proper Drupal APIs (Entity API, dependency injection)
4. Manage configuration export/import
5. Implement proper caching and performance patterns

## What you get after installation

### Core Drupal Work Agents

```

## What actually gets installed

```
your-project/
â”œâ”€â”€ CLAUDE.md                    # Behavioral rules for agents
â”œâ”€â”€ .claude/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ settings.json           # Hook configuration
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ agents/                 # Agent definitions (30+ files)
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ prd-research-agent.md
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ task-orchestrator.md
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ lib/
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ research-analyzer.js  # Complexity analysis engine
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ... (lots more agents)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ hooks/                  # TDD enforcement scripts
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ test-driven-handoff.sh
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ collective-metrics.sh
â””â”€â”€ .claude-collective/
    â”œâ”€â”€ tests/                  # Test framework templates
    â”œâ”€â”€ metrics/                # Usage tracking (for development)
    â””â”€â”€ package.json           # Testing setup (Vitest)
```

## How It Works

### 1. Complexity Assessment
Main Claude reads `CLAUDE.md` and assesses task complexity (Level 1-4)

### 2. Agent Routing
- **Level 1**: Direct execution (drush commands, file operations)
- **Level 2**: 2-4 specialized agents
- **Level 3**: 5-9 agents with Task Master coordination
- **Level 4**: Full project with phased agent deployment

### 3. Drupal Development Workflow
```
Architecture â†’ Implementation â†’ Quality Gates â†’ Testing â†’ Deployment
```

### 4. Quality Gate Validation
Every implementation passes through:
- âœ… Drupal coding standards (phpcs)
- âœ… Security review (SQL injection, XSS, access control)
- âœ… Performance validation (caching, queries)
- âœ… Accessibility checks (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- âœ… Integration testing (Playwright)

### 5. Delivery Standard
```
## DRUPAL FEATURE COMPLETE

âœ… Module created: my_custom_module
âœ… Coding standards: PASS (0 errors, 0 warnings)
âœ… Security review: PASS
âœ… Functional tests: PASS
âœ… Configuration exported
ðŸ“Š Ready for deployment
```

## Management Commands

```bash
# Check installation status
npx drupal-claude-collective status

# Validate installation integrity
npx drupal-claude-collective validate

# Repair installation
npx drupal-claude-collective repair

# Remove collective
npx drupal-claude-collective clean

# Get help
npx drupal-claude-collective --help
```

## Current State

### What Works Well
- Drupal coding standards enforcement prevents common issues
- Security reviews catch vulnerabilities early
- Agents understand Drupal APIs and best practices
- Configuration management is handled automatically
- Quality gates ensure production-ready code

### Experimental Features
- Theme development agent (works but being refined)
- Content migration agent (handles basic scenarios)
- Visual regression testing (depends on Playwright setup)

### Known Limitations
- Requires existing Drupal 10/11 installation
- Best for custom module/theme development
- Requires Node.js >= 16
- Need Task Master MCP for complex projects (Level 3-4)
- Agents work best with clear, detailed requirements

## Testing Your Installation

After installing:

```bash
# 1. Validate installation
npx drupal-claude-collective validate

# 2. Check status
npx drupal-claude-collective status

# 3. Restart Claude Code (if hooks were installed)

# 4. Try a simple task
# In Claude Code: "Add a 'Featured' boolean field to the Article content type"
# Expected: Direct execution via drush

# 5. Try a Level 2 feature
# In Claude Code: "Create a custom block plugin that displays the 5 most recent articles"
# Expected: module-development-agent â†’ security-compliance-agent â†’ functional-testing-agent
```

## Troubleshooting

### Installation fails
- Check Node.js version: `node --version` (need >= 16)
- Clear npm cache: `npm cache clean --force`
- Try force install: `npx claude-code-collective init --force`

### Agents don't work
- Restart Claude Code (hooks need to load)
- Check `.claude/settings.json` exists
- Run `npx claude-code-collective validate`

### Tests don't run
- Make sure your project has a test runner (Jest, Vitest, etc.)
- Check if tests are actually being written to files
- Look at the TDD completion reports from agents

### Research is slow
- Context7 might be having connectivity issues
- Agent might be being thorough (this varies)
- Check `.claude-collective/metrics/` for timing data

## Requirements

### System Requirements
- **Node.js**: >= 16.0.0
- **NPM**: >= 8.0.0
- **Claude Code**: Latest version with MCP support

### Drupal Requirements
- **Drupal**: 10.x or 11.x
- **PHP**: 8.1+
- **Drush**: 12+
- **Composer**: Latest version

### Development Tools
- **PHP_CodeSniffer**: With Drupal standards (`drupal/coder`)
- **PHPStan**: For static analysis (recommended)
- **Playwright**: For functional testing (optional but recommended)

## What This Is and Isn't

### What It Is
- Drupal development aid for building production-ready modules and themes
- Collection of Drupal-specialized AI agents
- Adapted from claude-code-sub-agent-collective for Drupal CMS
- Opinionated about Drupal best practices

### What It Isn't
- A replacement for Drupal knowledge
- Guaranteed to handle every edge case
- A substitute for code review
- Magic that requires zero Drupal understanding

## Why Drupal-Specific Agents?

Generic AI assistants often produce Drupal code that:
- Violates coding standards
- Contains security vulnerabilities
- Uses deprecated APIs
- Ignores configuration management
- Has poor performance patterns

Drupal-specialized agents enforce:
- Proper use of Entity API
- Dependency injection patterns
- Security best practices
- Configuration export workflows
- Performance and caching standards

## Research features (experimental)

To make agents smarter about modern development:

- **Context7 integration** - real, current library documentation
- **ResearchDrivenAnalyzer** - intelligent complexity assessment
- **Smart task breakdown** - only creates subtasks when actually needed
- **Best practice application** - research-informed patterns

This stuff is experimental and sometimes overthinks things, but generally helpful.

## Solutions to common agent problems

AI agents can be unreliable. Here's what I built to deal with that:

**Agents ignoring TDD rules**: Hook system enforces test-first development before any code gets written.

**Agents bypassing directives**: CLAUDE.md behavioral operating system with prime directives that override default behavior.

**Agents stopping mid-task**: Test-driven handoff validation ensures work gets completed or explicitly handed off.

**Agents making up APIs**: Context7 integration forces agents to use real, current documentation.

**Agents taking wrong approach**: Central routing through **@task-orchestrator** hub prevents agents from self-selecting incorrectly.

**Agents breaking coordination**: Hub-and-spoke architecture eliminates peer-to-peer communication chaos.

**Agents skipping quality steps**: Quality gates that block completion until standards are met.

**Agents losing context**: Handoff contracts preserve required information across agent transitions.

**Agents providing inconsistent output**: Standardized TDD completion reporting from every implementation agent.

**Agents working on wrong priorities**: ResearchDrivenAnalyzer scores complexity to focus effort appropriately.

Most of these are enforced automatically through hooks and behavioral constraints, not just hoping agents follow instructions.
