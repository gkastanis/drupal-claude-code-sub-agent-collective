- New view mode creation
- Custom field formatter/widget
- Theme component development
- Simple migration

**Agents**: Drupal Architect → Module/Theme Dev → Functional Testing → Security Gate

### Level 3: Multi-Component Systems (5-7 agents)
- Custom module with multiple plugins
- Complex content architecture
- Custom theme with advanced features
- API integration with external systems
- Complex migration with transformations
- Custom workflow implementation

**Agents**: PM → Drupal Architect → Research → Module Dev → Theme Dev → Config Management → Functional Testing → Security Gate → Performance Gate → Integration Gate

### Level 4: Full Drupal Projects (8-12 agents)
- Complete site builds from requirements

## Workflow Patterns

### Pattern 1: Level 2 Feature Development
```
1. @architect - Analyze feature and plan approach
2. @module-dev OR @theme-dev - Implement feature
3. @security - Security review → GATE
4. @functional-test - Browser validation
5. If FAIL: @module-dev - Fix issues and re-test
6. If PASS: COMPLETE
```

### Pattern 2: Level 3 Multi-Component System
```
1. PM Agent - Break down project using Task Master
2. @architect - Design overall architecture
3. @module-dev - Develop custom modules
4. @theme-dev - Develop theme components
5. @config-mgmt - Set up configuration management
6. @security → Security Gate
7. @performance-devops → Performance Gate
8. @functional-test - Comprehensive testing
9. @integration - Validate all components together → Integration Gate
10. If any FAIL: Coordinate fixes and re-validate
11. If all PASS: COMPLETE
```

### Pattern 3: Level 4 Full Project
```
Phase 1: Planning & Architecture
- PM Agent: Parse requirements, create tasks
- @architect: Complete architectural design
- @security: Security planning
- @performance-devops: Infrastructure planning
→ Readiness Gate

Phase 2: Core Implementation
- @content-migration: Content architecture
- @module-dev: Core custom modules
- @theme-dev: Base theme structure
- @config-mgmt: Config framework
→ Functional Testing → Quality Gate

Phase 3: Features & Integration
- @module-dev: Feature modules
- @theme-dev: Advanced components
- @functional-test: User journey testing
- @unit-test: Comprehensive test coverage
→ All Gates (Security, Performance, Accessibility, Integration)

Phase 4: Final Validation & Deployment
- @visual-test: Visual regression
- @performance-devops: Final optimization & deployment setup
- @functional-test: Full site validation
→ Production Readiness Gate → COMPLETE
```

## Tool Coordination

### Task Master MCP Usage
- PM Agent: Full read/write for task creation and coordination
- All other agents: Read-only to see assigned tasks and dependencies

### Drush Commands (via Bash)
Common commands agents should use:
```bash
# Cache clear
drush cr

# Configuration export
drush cex -y

# Configuration import
drush cim -y

# Run updates
drush updb -y

# Check status
drush status

# Module enable/disable
drush en module_name -y
drush pmu module_name -y
```

### Composer Commands (via Bash)
```bash
# Require module
composer require drupal/module_name

# Require dev dependency
composer require --dev drupal/module_name

# Update dependencies
composer update

# Validate composer.json
composer validate
```

### Code Quality Commands
```bash
# Drupal coding standards check
phpcs --standard=Drupal,DrupalPractice web/modules/custom/

# PHP static analysis
phpstan analyse web/modules/custom/

# Run PHPUnit tests
./vendor/bin/phpunit web/modules/custom/
```

## Communication Patterns

### Agent to Agent
Agents communicate through Task Master or via main orchestrator. Each agent outputs structured results:

```yaml
agent: module-dev
status: COMPLETE
output:
  - Created custom module: my_custom_module
  - Files: my_custom_module.info.yml, my_custom_module.module
  - Implemented hooks: hook_form_alter, hook_entity_presave
  - Location: web/modules/custom/my_custom_module
next_agent: security
validation_needed: true
```

### Error Recovery
When a gate returns FAIL:
1. Main orchestrator receives failure report with details
2. Route back to appropriate agent with specific issues
3. Agent fixes and signals completion
4. Re-run validation gate
5. Repeat until PASS

## Quality Standards

All deliverables must meet:
1. **Drupal Coding Standards**: Pass phpcs check
2. **Security**: No known vulnerabilities, proper sanitization
3. **Performance**: Efficient queries, proper caching
4. **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA minimum
5. **Documentation**: Inline comments, README files
6. **Testing**: Adequate test coverage for custom code

## Project Initialization

For new projects:
1. Ensure Drupal is installed and accessible
2. Initialize Task Master: `npx task-master-ai init`
3. Configure model: `npx task-master-ai models --setMain claude-code/sonnet`
4. Verify Drush is available: `drush status`
5. Confirm Composer is configured
6. Set up code quality tools (phpcs, phpstan)

## Example Usage

**Simple request (Level 1)**:
> "Add an email field to the Article content type"

**Action**: Execute directly with Drush/admin commands

**Feature request (Level 2)**:
> "Create a custom block that displays the 5 most recent articles with featured images"

**Action**: 
1. @architect - Plan approach (custom block plugin)
2. @module-dev - Implement custom block plugin
3. @security - Review code
4. @functional-test - Test in browser
5. COMPLETE

**Complex request (Level 3)**:
> "Build a custom event management system with registration, calendar display, and email notifications"

**Action**:
1. PM breaks into tasks via Task Master
2. @architect designs content model and module structure
3. @module-dev creates custom module with plugins
4. @theme-dev creates templates and styles
5. @config-mgmt sets up configs
6. Run all gates
7. @functional-test comprehensive testing
8. COMPLETE

**Full project (Level 4)**:
> "Build a complete university department website with faculty profiles, course catalog, news section, events calendar, and student resources. Implement from attached PRD."

**Action**: Full phased approach with all agents, multiple validation cycles

## Success Criteria

A project is COMPLETE when:
- All required functionality is implemented
- All quality gates PASS
- Functional testing validates user journeys
- Code follows Drupal standards
- Security review passes
- Performance is optimized
- Accessible to WCAG standards
- Properly documented
- Configuration is exportable

## Maintenance Mode

For existing Drupal sites:
- Analyze current architecture before changes
- Respect existing patterns and conventions
- Test thoroughly in isolated environment
- Use configuration management for changes
- Document all modifications
